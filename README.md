# React Tic Tac Toe App 

Frameworks I added
- Flux
- Immutable
- React-Bootstrap

Approach and steps taken into the design of the app

1. Started with layout, leveraging bootstrap so I could simulate having a comp or wire-frame to reference and apply the requirements to.
2. Created the app state (models) because I knew I wanted to use Flux to show my understanding of View-Model paradigms, also because this is a best practice for scalability and app management. 
3. Wrote the logic first without flux, this allowed me to really look at anything I may have missed in the original state design. 
4. Broke everything into Flux and used some Immutable.js as well, I used multiple stores to just show again the understanding of these paradigms in app development. 
5. Cleaned up things best I could without taking too much more time
6. For the presentation layer (CSS), I wanted to show case my design skills as well as some common CSS3 features for UX. I used react-bootstrap components to get some widgets quickly working , i.e. modals. 

General comments:

Overall my goals were to showcase primarily my JavaScript Engineering, Application State Design, Application Structure and Architecture for a Production Level App. I wanted to overdo it on purpose to just show my experience building Rich Internet Applications. Keeping it simple for this exercise was not my goal, I wanted to bring everything to the table so we can hopefully discuss it. 

I chose to use a grid system for the detection of the winning combo, initially I wanted to use this grid system to also add a vs. CPU mode, however I just couldn't get enough time, but that was the initial thought of the use for the grid system and storing the moves within a combo object. Fun project I can spend more hours on for sure, and maybe I will add the CPU mode for kicks. 

I'm not a React developer, but I am a JavaScript developer for sure, I did have to read on React a bit to refresh my memory from the last time I researched and played with the framework.
